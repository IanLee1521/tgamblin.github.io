I came to LLNL in 2008 while still a graduate student at
[UNC](https://www.unc.edu).  After graduating in 2009, I spent a year
as a postdoc, and I joined the staff in 2010.  In the past, I've been
a software developer in Tokyo and an undergraduate at [Williams
College](http://www.williams.edu).

I'm happy to be here because I get to play a small part in
accelerating scientific advances.  Supercomputers are used to simulate
scientific phenomena: everything from
[earthquakes](http://computation.llnl.gov//research/project-highlights/numerical-methods-boost-modeling-efficiency)
to [giant lasers](http://computation.llnl.gov/research/mission-support/NIF) to
the [human heart](http://hpcinnovationcenter.llnl.gov/cardioid-heart-modeling.php).
