<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> [Todd's CV](todd-cv.pdf)

I am a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
and I work on performance tools and performance analysis.  My reearch
focuses on scalable tools and algorithms for measuring, analyzing,
visualizing, and understanding massively parallel applications running
on supercomputers.

I'm happy to be here because it means I get to play a small part in
accelerating advances in science.  Supercomputers are used to simulate
everything from
[earthquakes](http://computation.llnl.gov//research/project-highlights/numerical-methods-boost-modeling-efficiency)
to [giant
lasers](http://computation.llnl.gov/research/mission-support/NIF) to
the [human
heart](http://hpcinnovationcenter.llnl.gov/cardioid-heart-modeling.php).

I came to LLNL in 2008 while still a graduate student at [UNC Chapel
Hill](https://www.unc.edu).  After graduating in 2009, I did a postdoc,
and became staff in 2010.  In past lives, I've been a software
developer in Tokyo and an undergraduate at
[Williams College](http://www.williams.edu).
