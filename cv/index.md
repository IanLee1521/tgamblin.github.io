Todd is a computer scientist in the Center for Applied Scientific
Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. His research
focuses on scalable tools for measuring, analyzing, and visualizing
performance data from massively parallel applications.  Todd is also
involved with many production projects at LLNL.  He works with
Livermore Computing's Development Environment Group to build tools
that allow users to deploy, run, debug, and optimize their software
for machines with million-way concurrency.

Todd received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2009.  His dissertation investigated
parallel methods for compressing and sampling performance measurements
from hundreds of thousands of concurrent processors. He received his
B.A. in Computer Science and Japanese from Williams College in
2002. He has also worked as a software developer in Tokyo and held
