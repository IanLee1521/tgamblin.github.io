I am looking for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to
work on a new project using machine learning to model the performance
of parallel applications, with a focus on data-dependent and adaptive
algorithms.

This job is part of a much larger set of efforts on performance analysis,
tools, debugging, modeling, visualization, and other aspects of HPC.

If this sounds interesting to you, [email me!](mailto:tgamblin@llnl.gov)
